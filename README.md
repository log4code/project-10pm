- Free form email
- Email newsletters
- Public and private mobile apps with messaging/chat
- Paper communication
- Text messaging channels
- Social media feeds and private groups

The information medium may be in:
- Text
- Video
- Image
- Text presented within an image
- Audio

## Technology

Initial focus will be on a web based application (possibly a progressive web app to bridge to mobile devices in the short term)
